### üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I am a Computer Science graduate student at Portland State University with a strong foundation in predictive modeling, machine learning, and advanced analytics. I build solutions using Python, SQL, and Scikit-learn to solve complex business problems.

In my professional role, I **enhanced anomalous behavior detection by 30%** by designing and implementing a predictive modeling system.

I am now focusing my passion and skills on the fields of **AI Engineering and Prompt Engineering**, with a deep interest in generative models and MLOps.

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently building a portfolio of projects focused on generative AI and production-ready ML pipelines.
- üå± Ask me about predictive modeling, Python, or feature engineering.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I received the ELSA Award at PSU for mentoring international students.
