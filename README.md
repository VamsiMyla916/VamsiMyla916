### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Computer Science graduate student at Portland State University with a strong foundation in predictive modeling, machine learning, and advanced analytics. I build solutions using Python, SQL, and Scikit-learn to solve complex business problems.

In my professional role, I **enhanced anomalous behavior detection by 30%** by designing and implementing a predictive modeling system.

I am now focusing my passion and skills on the fields of **AI Engineering and Prompt Engineering**, with a deep interest in generative models and MLOps.

- 🔭 I’m currently building end-to-end generative AI applications with Streamlit and FastAPI.
- 🌱 Ask me about RAG pipelines, object detection, or building ML APIs.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I received the ELSA Award at PSU for mentoring international students.
